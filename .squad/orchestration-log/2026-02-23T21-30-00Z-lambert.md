# Orchestration Log: Lambert
**Session:** 2026-02-23T21-30-00Z  
**Agent:** Lambert (Visual Designer)  
**Mode:** background

## Work Completed

### Redesigned StatsPanel as Floating Glass Overlay
- Positioned `absolute right-4 top-4` inside simulation view
- Glass effect: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` + `rgba(10, 22, 40, 0.88)` background
- Border: `1px solid rgba(0, 180, 216, 0.3)` for subtle ocean accent
- Layered box shadow for depth without harsh edges
- Vertical toggle tab on left edge using `writingMode: vertical-rl`
- Collapse animation: `translateX` transition 0.25s ease

### Species Count Badges
- Redesigned as 2×2 grid layout (plankton, sardine, shark, crab)
- Each badge: emoji + count, color-matched to species palette
- Background: `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` for subtle delineation
- Immediately visible at panel top for population snapshot

## Design Rationale
- **Ocean grid dominance:** Gives grid full viewport width by default
- **Glass doesn't obscure:** Frosted backdrop allows grid visibility when expanded
- **Discoverable toggle:** Tab is always visible but doesn't compete with content
- **Visual consistency:** Uses existing deep-ocean dark palette

## Key Files Modified
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — removed 65fr/35fr grid, now uses relative positioning
- `frontend/src/components/stats/StatsPanel.tsx` — glass styling, collapse state, species badges

## Breaking Changes
- StatsPanel no longer accepts `controls` prop (moved to footer by Parker)
- Updated test IDs: `data-testid="left-panel"` and `data-testid="right-panel"` → `data-testid="simulation-view"` and `data-testid="stats-panel"`

## Cross-Coordination
- Coordinated with Parker on header height and footer layout
- Coordinated with Bishop on chart redesign fitting within glass panel
- Panel height: auto-scales with content; no interference with footer

## Notes
- Glass effect creates visual depth while maintaining grid visibility
- Collapse/expand toggle provides space efficiency without hiding data
- Species badges provide quick scan of population without reading charts
