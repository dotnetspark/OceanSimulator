# Orchestration Log: Ripley
**Session:** 2026-02-23T21-30-00Z  
**Agent:** Ripley (Lead)  
**Mode:** background

## Work Completed

### Enhanced Documentation with Mermaid Diagrams
Added 8 GitHub-compatible Mermaid diagrams to improve architecture and design visibility.

#### README.md Diagrams (3)
1. **Stack Architecture** (`graph TB`)
   - Shows layers: React/TypeScript/Vite (frontend) → SignalR/API layer → C#/.NET 8 (backend)
   - Testing validation loops for both layers
   - Visual hierarchy of technology stack

2. **Food Chain Relationships** (`graph LR`)
   - Plankton → Sardine → Shark → Dead → Crab
   - Shows predator-prey ecosystem dynamics
   - Color-coded by trophic level

3. **Frontend Component Tree** (`graph TD`)
   - SimulationView as central hub
   - Connections to SimulationControls, OceanGrid, StatsPanel
   - Shows data flow and component relationships

#### docs/ARCHITECTURE.md Diagrams (5)
1. **Clean Architecture Layers** (`graph TB`)
   - API → Infrastructure → Application → Domain
   - Dependency direction shown with arrows
   - Boundary verification for zero external dependencies in Domain

2. **Design Patterns Inventory** (`graph LR`)
   - 6 patterns visualized: Polymorphism, Factory, Template Method, Observer, Repository, Builder
   - Shows pattern relationships and usage contexts

3. **Entity Hierarchy** (`classDiagram`)
   - Specimen base → LivingSpecimen/Crab/Reef
   - EnergeticSpecimen → concrete species (Plankton, Sardine, Shark)
   - DeadSardine, DeadShark as distinct entities

4. **Specimen State Machine** (`stateDiagram-v2`)
   - Individual specimen lifecycle
   - States: Created → Living → Breeding/Feeding/Moving → Dying → Dead
   - Transitions based on energy, starvation, predation

5. **Snapshot Execution Flow** (`flowchart TD`)
   - Template Method pattern in action
   - 6-step sequence: Get Specimens → Shuffle → Iterate → Reset Counters → Count Population → Publish Events
   - Key insight: offspring created in Snapshot N don't move until Snapshot N+1

### Pattern & Style
- **Focused diagrams:** One concept per diagram
- **Visual cues:** Emoji used for layer/concern identification
- **Color-coding:** By layer (Domain/App/Infra/API) or concern type
- **Inline styling:** Markdown-compatible Mermaid features
- **Preservation:** All existing prose maintained; diagrams are additive, not replacements

## Key Files Modified
- `README.md` — Added 3 diagrams (stack, food chain, component tree)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Added 5 diagrams (Clean Architecture, patterns, entity hierarchy, state machine, snapshot flow)

## Documentation Impact
- **Discoverability:** Visual diagrams make architecture instantly understandable
- **Onboarding:** New team members can grasp design patterns from visual reference
- **Decision support:** Diagrams reinforce why Clean Architecture boundaries exist
- **Technical spec:** Mermaid syntax is GitHub-native, requires no external tools

## Cross-Coordination
- Diagrams document decisions made by Parker (layout), Lambert (visual system), Bishop (chart strategy)
- No code changes required — pure documentation enhancement
- All diagrams use existing component names and patterns — accurate reflection of current codebase

## Notes
- Mermaid diagrams are searchable in GitHub (in markdown)
- GitHub supports Mermaid natively (no plugins required)
- Diagrams can be updated as architecture evolves
- Format allows for future expansion (e.g., API endpoint flow, database schema)
