# Orchestration Log: Dallas (CI/CD Setup)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24T12-28-44Z  
**Agent:** Dallas (Backend Dev)  
**Task:** Rewrote squad-ci.yml with backend (.NET 10 xUnit) and frontend (Vitest) jobs; created e2e.yml (Playwright, manual trigger); added 5 README badges.

## Outcome

- **Commit:** 1d1de8b
- **Changes:**
  - `.github/workflows/squad-ci.yml` — restructured with `backend` (.NET 10 xUnit) and `frontend` (Vitest) jobs
  - `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — created with Playwright tests (manual trigger)
  - `README.md` — added 5 badges (build status, test coverage, license, etc.)

## Key Decisions Made

1. Job names `backend` and `frontend` are contractual — they must not change without updating GitHub branch protection rules
2. E2E tests run separately and are manually triggered (not on every PR)
3. Badges in README provide quick visibility into CI status

## Status

✓ Complete
