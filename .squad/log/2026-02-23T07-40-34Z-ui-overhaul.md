# Session Log: UI Overhaul — 2026-02-23T07:40:34Z

**Issue:** UI is not user friendly  
**Agent Dispatched:** Parker (Frontend Dev)  
**Scope:** Comprehensive UI/UX overhaul — ConfigPanel, SimulationControls, StatsPanel, App.tsx, index.css, App.css

## Work Summary

Parker completed full frontend UX pass:
- **ConfigPanel:** Multi-step form with clear labels, input validation, accessible form structure
- **SimulationControls:** Play/pause/stop buttons, snapshot counter, control layout refinement
- **StatsPanel:** Population graphs, birth/death tracking, visual clarity
- **App.tsx:** Component integration, state management, SignalR event handling
- **Styling:** index.css (global reset, typography, utilities) and App.css (layout, responsive grid)

## Decisions Merged

Seven decisions merged from agent inboxes:
- Ash: E2E testing patterns (10 test cases, data-testid strategy, Playwright setup)
- Ash: Test coverage strategy (65 backend domain tests, 16 frontend component tests, 32 integration tests)
- Dallas: Backend architecture patterns (Clean Architecture, Template Method, entity design)
- Lambert: Visual design decisions (color palette, animation philosophy, graph integration)
- Parker: Frontend architecture patterns (reducer state, grid rendering, API layer, SignalR)
- Ripley: Architecture decisions (4-layer design, SOLID, randomness seeding, TypeScript strict mode)
- Ripley: PR review findings (behavior embedding confirmed, dead specimens as entities, tech debt logged)

## Outcome

Decisions consolidated in .squad/decisions.md. All UI components ready for testing phase.
