# Session Log: RunUntilEvent Endpoint Fix

**Date:** 2026-02-24T12:33:04Z  
**Agent:** Dallas (Backend Dev)

## What Happened

Implemented `POST /api/simulation/run/event` endpoint. Previously a stub returning `{message: "RunUntilEvent not yet implemented"}`, now loops snapshots until birth/death event occurs, returning standard `SnapshotResult` shape.

## Key Changes

- Removed errant `[FromBody] string` parameter
- Loop caps at 10,000 iterations
- Resolves frontend NaN issue with `snapshotNumber`

## Outcome

- Build: 0 errors
- Commit: ee97d24
